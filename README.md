### _Getting started_

Instructions on how to use the app:

1. To start the game, click on the "DEAL" button. 
2. If both yours and dealer's score is below 21, you can choose to "HIT" or "STAY".
3. You can click "HIT" as many times as you want as long as your score is below 21. 
4. If you choose to "STAY" and dealer's score is below 17, dealer's first card will be revealed and they will take another card. 
5. Alternatively, if you choose to "STAY" and dealer's score is above 17, only dealer's first card will be revealed but they will not get a third card. 
6. Follow messages on the bottom of the game board. For example, press "RESET" to start the game again.
